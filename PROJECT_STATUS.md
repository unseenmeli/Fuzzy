# Fuzzy Project Status Report

## ✅ Fixed Issues

### 1. Security & Configuration
- ✅ Moved API key to environment variable (.env.local)
- ✅ Added proper .gitignore file
- ✅ Added environment variable handling with fallback

### 2. Error Handling
- ✅ Created ErrorBoundary component for React error catching
- ✅ Added error utilities for consistent error handling
- ✅ Wrapped app with ErrorBoundary in _layout.tsx

### 3. Type Safety
- ✅ Created comprehensive types file (src/types/index.ts)
- ✅ Defined interfaces for all database entities
- ✅ Added proper theme typing

### 4. Navigation
- ✅ Fixed navigation context error by using Redirect component
- ✅ Created reusable BottomNav component
- ✅ Added Settings page with proper navigation
- ✅ Fixed broken navigation icons in fingerTap.tsx

### 5. Database Structure
- ✅ Separated user profiles from system $users table
- ✅ Added proper relationships between entities
- ✅ Implemented friend code system

## ⚠️ Known Issues Still Present

### 1. Incomplete Features
- Mood and note system (placeholder only)
- Most mini-games not implemented
- Image upload needs size limits
- No push notifications
- No offline sync
- Map feature incomplete
- Star Gazing, Future Planning, Spicy Convo not implemented

### 2. Performance Issues
- Multiple separate database queries could be batched
- No memoization for expensive operations
- Images stored as base64 (inefficient)

### 3. UI/UX Issues
- No loading states in some components
- Missing accessibility labels
- Inconsistent error messages
- Some hardcoded placeholder text

### 4. Code Quality
- Some components too large (index.tsx has 400+ lines)
- Inline styles mixed with Tailwind
- Magic numbers throughout code
- No unit tests

## 📋 Recommended Next Steps

### High Priority
1. Implement proper image storage (use cloud storage, not base64)
2. Add loading states to all async operations
3. Implement actual mood/note functionality
4. Add input validation throughout

### Medium Priority
1. Break down large components
2. Implement remaining mini-games
3. Add push notifications
4. Implement offline sync with InstantDB

### Low Priority
1. Add accessibility features
2. Write unit tests
3. Optimize bundle size
4. Add analytics

## 🏗️ Project Structure
```
src/
├── app/              # Routes/Pages
├── components/       # Reusable components
├── types/           # TypeScript types
├── utils/           # Utilities
└── media/           # Static assets
```

## 🔧 Configuration Files
- `.env.local` - Environment variables (not in git)
- `.gitignore` - Git ignore rules
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript config
- `tailwind.config.js` - Tailwind CSS config
- `metro.config.js` - Metro bundler config
- `app.json` - Expo configuration

## 📱 Working Features
- User authentication (magic link)
- Username selection with friend codes
- Creating relationships, friendships, groups
- Switching between chats
- Basic profile viewing
- Friend code sharing
- Truth or Dare game (partial)

## 🐛 Critical Bugs
- Image picker shows deprecation warning
- Some navigation icons still broken in other screens
- Database queries without error boundaries
- No rollback on failed transactions

## 💡 Architecture Recommendations
1. Consider using React Query for data fetching
2. Implement proper state management (Redux/Zustand)
3. Use React Hook Form for form handling
4. Consider moving to Supabase for better file storage
5. Implement proper CI/CD pipeline

## 📊 Performance Metrics
- Bundle size: Not optimized
- Initial load time: Could be improved with code splitting
- Database queries: Need optimization
- Image handling: Very inefficient (base64)

## 🔒 Security Considerations
- API keys now in env variables ✅
- No input sanitization in some places
- Friend codes could be more secure (longer/encrypted)
- No rate limiting on API calls
- User data not encrypted locally

## 📝 Documentation Needed
- API documentation
- Component documentation
- Setup instructions
- Deployment guide
- Contributing guidelines

## 🚀 Deployment Readiness
**Current Status: NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION**

### Must Fix Before Launch:
1. Complete error handling
2. Implement all core features
3. Add proper loading states
4. Fix all TypeScript errors
5. Implement proper image storage
6. Add input validation
7. Security audit
8. Performance optimization
9. Comprehensive testing

### Estimated Time to Production:
With dedicated development: 2-3 weeks minimum

## 💻 Development Environment
- React Native with Expo
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS (NativeWind)
- InstantDB for backend
- Expo Router for navigation

## 🎯 Success Metrics to Track
- User retention
- Daily active users
- Feature usage statistics
- Error rates
- Performance metrics
- User feedback scores
